We aim to quantify mutational processes and phenotypic transitions in mammalian cells and cancer model systems, by combining experimental evolution and mathematical modeling. To this aim, we work on the develoopment of quantitative frameworks ispired by the famous Luria-Delbruck fluctuation assay to quantify the phenotypic swith to the persister phenotype and the mutation rate of cancer cells treated with growth-inhibitory targeted therapies. We also work on inference methods for the quantification of the genomic mutation rate using sequencing data collected in controlled experimental setups.
