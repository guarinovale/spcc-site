We are interested in the physical aspects of chromosome organization and dynamics that play a relevant physiological role in the cell. We model how bridging proteins, external tension and crowding from the nucleoplasm or the bacterial cytoplasm affect chromosome organization, dynamics and propagation of mechanical stress. We are particularly interested in the role played by chromosomes in cell cycle decisions.
