We work on quantitative models for cell growth that describe how cells proliferate under different enviromental conditions. One of our main goals is understanding the regulatory circuits that govern cell growth and how those circuits react to perturbations such as nutrient limitations or drug treatment. We aprroach this question using both data-driven and model-driven methods: we make use of data provided from our experimental collaborators to build models, and we plan new experiments based on our models to test the model predictions. We are actively working on E. coli, yeast and cultured mammalian cell lines, to find common and specific traits of growth regulation.
