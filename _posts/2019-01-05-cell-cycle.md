We are interested in how cells control cell-cycle progression to ensure that key processes are brought to completion. New dynamic single-cell data challenge standard views and raise new questions. Quantitative models are needed to infer the key mechanisms and guide the experiments. In E. coli, with single-cell experiments, extensive data-analysis and modeling study, we have recently reported that a concurrency between processes happening both at the chromosome and the cell level typically limit cell division with comparable odds, which vey with conditions and perturbations. In single cultured mammalian cells, we have shown that both subperiod timing adjustments and growth-rate regulation contribute to cell-cycle progression decisions. In yeast and in breast cancer cells, we are currently exploring how the extreme deviation of cell size from homeostatic values during a G1 cell-cycle arrest can affect cell proliferation after release from the arrest.
